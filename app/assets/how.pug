        li #[strong Measurable] - We only support projects that have a clear protocol for measuring how much greenhouse gas they prevented or sequestered. This way, you can be sure projects you support offset as much carbon as they claim to.
        li #[strong Additional] - All projects we support would not happen without your help. In general, they're not economically feasible without being paid for the CO2 they offset.
        li #[strong Transparent] - We prioritize projects that share as much information as possible. This way, anyone can verify that the offset project is additional, measurable, and overall a great way to make some small dent in the climate crisis we face.
